# MAME_Dats
MAME dats (xml and clrmame formats)

Here you will be able to find dats, both MAME and some derivatives (Arcade and HBMAME).
In the main folders of the repository you will find the latest available dat or xml, so you can check for changes.

In the folder "pS_Resources" are the dats related to the resources you can download from my site: https://www.progettosnaps.net/

Current version 0.265.
